# （1）Huge crowd stirred hearts with classic Chinese song

```markdown
A huge crowd materialized in Beijing's Tian'anmen Square on Tuesday evening to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

A group of teenagers playing accordians, sang the classic song Me and My Motherland as they strolled past the Golden Water Bridge at the foot of the Tian'anmen Rostrum, which separates the Forbidden City from Chang'an Avenue.

The singers were joined by tens of thousands people, who showed up for the grand gala in Tian'anmen Square. President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders and guests lined the Rostrum.

"It might have been the biggest crowd ever to form in such a short interval at such an iconic site," Zhang Yimou, chief director of the gala told Xinhua News Agency.

"The teenagers suddenly appeared on the Golden Water Bridge and started the gathering. People came and sang along with them. All the participants were amateur singers. As more people joined the crowd, it was very touching."
