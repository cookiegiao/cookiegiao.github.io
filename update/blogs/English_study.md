#### 说两句

实际上这两天心情是挺烦闷的。学习网安，感觉好辛苦，也不是学习本身让我感到辛苦，这个过程中，我也是乐在其中。感觉身边的人一天一天都在进步，可是自己一直在原地踏步，没有比别人更好的天赋，也没法像别人那样去压榨自己的正常休息时间，去学习。我真的觉得好辛苦......

title:An ode to the moon
```

```
Mid-Autumn Festival is a time when Chinese families embrace folk customs, Xu Lin reports.
```

folk cutoms 　民俗



```
Celebrated on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival-which falls on Sept 13 this year-is an occasion where Chinese people traditionally hold family reunions, enjoy mooncakes and marvel at the beauty of the large, round moon.
```

family reunions   家庭聚会

marvel   奇迹; 不平凡的成果.





```
While folk customs differ from region to region, people across China like to celebrate the festival in their own way and pass on the festival spirit to the next generation.
```

region   区域

pass on  传递



```
Li Baoqi, pastry chef of Hua's Restaurant in Beijing, was busy teaching guests and their children how to make traditional Beijing-style fanmao (rolling feather) mooncakes ahead of the festival.

It's a pastry that was enjoyed by emperors at banquets during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Legend has it that Empress Dowager Cixi once pounded the table with her hand, causing the crust to "flutter" like feathers.
```

 Legend has it that  相传......

pound   锤打

```
Packed with chopped walnuts and peanuts, each mooncake weighs 250 grams and has a white surface with a red stamp bearing an auspicious motif made of strawberry jam. Li says in order to cater to healthier dining habits, they reduced the amount of sugar and added more nuts. They started to sell fanmao mooncakes in 2014 to revive the ancient recipe. All ingredients are meticulously made by hand.
```

每个月饼由切碎的核桃和花生包装而成，重250克，表面呈白色，上面有一枚印有草莓酱吉祥图案的红色印章。李说，为了迎合更健康的饮食习惯，他们减少了糖的用量，并添加了更多的坚果。2014年，他们开始销售梵茂月饼，以复兴这一古老配方。所有原料都是手工精心制作的。



```
"Children have great fun at these events and learn a lot about the festival," says Yue Jingyan, who took her two daughters to the restaurant to learn how to make mooncakes.

In the past, children in Beijing offered mooncakes, fruit and flowers to Tu'er Ye, or the Rabbit God, on the night of Mid-Autumn Festival. In modern times, the 400-year-old Rabbit God has gradually become a toy for children to play with during the festival, which is both a symbol of Beijing's folk culture and a tourism souvenir.

With a suit of armor, the god with the head of a rabbit and a human body is often seen riding on a tiger, an elephant or a deer, or even sitting on a lotus leaf-which all have different auspicious meanings. Legend has it that the Rabbit God is the incarnation of Jade Rabbit that lives in a palace on the moon with the mythological goddess, Chang'e.
```

“孩子们在这些活动中玩得很开心，也学到了很多关于节日的知识，”岳景燕说，她带着两个女儿去餐馆学习如何做月饼。



过去，北京的孩子们在中秋之夜向兔神屠儿爷献月饼、水果和鲜花。近现代，有400年历史的兔神逐渐成为节日期间孩子们玩耍的玩具，既是北京民俗文化的象征，也是旅游纪念品。



有了一套盔甲，常常可以看到兔头神人骑在虎、象、鹿身上，甚至坐在荷叶上，都有着不同的吉祥含义。传说兔神是玉兔的化身，与神话中的女神嫦娥一起生活在月宫里。

While police have always respected the citizens' freedom of speech rights, they have to be carried out in a peaceful and orderly manner and no one should resort to violence, he added.

US chipmaker cheers China tech
```

```
The executive of a top chipmaker in the US said that he is focused on collaborating with the company's Chinese partners and will continue to support technology launches in the country amid the US-China trade dispute.
```

executive  领导者，总经理

chipmaker 芯片制作商

collaborate 　v. 合作

amid   prep.在....中

dispute  n.   vt & vi.争论，辩论

美国一家顶级芯片制造商的高管表示，他专注于与该公司的中国合作伙伴合作，并将继续支持在美中贸易争端中在中国推出技术。



```
"I think it goes without saying that we spend a lot of time helping and supporting the deployment now of 5G in China. So we want to make sure that happens. Those activities are really unaffected by the trade war," Steve Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm, said during a media briefing Monday. 
```

“我认为不用说，我们花了很多时间来帮助和支持现在5G在中国的部署。所以我们要确保这一切发生。高通公司首席执行官史蒂夫•莫伦科夫（steve mollenkopf）周一在一次媒体简会上表示：“这些活动实际上不受贸易战的影响。”



```
The San Diego-based company hosted a series of workshops Tuesday and Wednesday at its headquarters to showcase what it envisions for 5G technologies and its own research in the area.
```

envision  vt.  幻想，想象，设想



```
The company's Chinese clients include Vivo, OPPO, Xiaomi, ZTE, OnePlus and Huawei, all of which have unveiled devices powered by Qualcomm's mobile platforms and modems.

Qualcomm lowered its estimate for device shipments by 100 million units for the end of 2019 in its third-quarter earnings report. It reported revenue of $4.9 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 13 percent year-over-year.

During an investor call, Mollenkopf said a weakness in market demand for 4G phones, particularly in China, in anticipation of the 5G rollout, has contributed to the drop in sales. He also mentioned the export ban on Huawei as having an effect on Qualcomm's revenue.
```

anticipation  n.期待，希望；预期，预测，预感；



```
"As a result of the export ban, Huawei shifted their emphasis to building market share in the domestic China market, where we do not see the corresponding benefit in product or licensing revenue," Mollenkopf said.
```

emphasis 　n.着重点

corresponding  adj.相当的，对应的



```
Frank Meng, chairman of Qualcomm China, said in an interview with China Daily that the trade conflict has had a damaging effect on the industry.

Huawei's American chip suppliers, including Qualcomm and Intel, are quietly pressing the US government to ease the ban on sales to Huawei, Reuters reported in June.
```



```
Citing concerns about national security, the Commerce Department put Huawei on the list in May, preventing the company from buying American-made technology.
```

美国商务部今年5月以对国家安全的担忧为由，将华为列入名单，阻止该公司购买美国制造的技术。



```
"And even with Huawei, we have been working very hard to makes sure that we can support them as best as we can, as every company of course has its restriction as a result of the commerce regulations, but we have been able to resume shipments there; we are obviously in applications to try to figure out how to even continue that in the future," he said.
```

restriction  n.限制，限令

commerce regulations　n.商业法规



```
The company later clarified that its sales included items exempted from an export ban involving the Chinese company.

Mollenkopf stressed the importance of the Chinese market for Qualcomm, citing the growing number of cellphone manufacturers in the country. It's a very important time for the two countries, and more importantly, for the launch of 5G worldwide, he said.

"We are working very hard to make sure that we continue to be supporting the technology launches and they are happening, independent of the trade war, and our job is to make sure that we can continue the partnerships that we have in place even during this difficult period of time, and hope that those things survive the trade war, whatever happens there," Mollenkopf added.
